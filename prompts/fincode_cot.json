            "answer": "Since the strike price ($100) is less than the price at expiration ($110), the trader would make $10 on every share they own at a cost of $2 per share. So the total gain per share is 10 - 2 = 8 dollars. Since there are 100 shares in the contract, the final profit is then 100 * 8 = $[[800]]"
