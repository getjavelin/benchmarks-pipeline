                "context": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2013 ( Continued ) ( Amounts in millions, except per share amounts ) \n\nGuarantees \nWe have guarantees of certain obligations of our subsidiaries relating principally to credit facilities, certain media payables and operating leases of certain subsidiaries. The amount of such parent company guarantees was $769.3 and $706.7 as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In the event of non-payment by the applicable subsidiary of the obligations covered by a guarantee, we would be obligated to pay the amounts covered by that guarantee. As of December 31, 2009, there are no material assets pledged as security for such parent company guarantees. Contingent acquisition obligations the following table details the estimated future contingent acquisition obligations payable in cash as of December 31, 2009. The estimated amounts listed would be paid in the event of exercise at the earliest exercise date. See note 6 for further information relating to the payment structure of our acquisitions. All payments are contingent upon achieving projected operating performance targets and satisfying other conditions specified in the related agreements and are subject to revisions as the earn-out periods progress.\n\n|  | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | Thereafter | Total |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Deferred acquisition payments | $20.5 | $34.8 | $1.2 | $1.1 | $2.1 | $0.3 | $60.0 |\n| Redeemable noncontrolling interests and call options with affiliates ( 1 ) | 44.4 | 47.9 | 40.5 | 36.3 | 3.3 | \u2014 | 172.4 |\n| Total contingent acquisition payments | 64.9 | 82.7 | 41.7 | 37.4 | 5.4 | 0.3 | 232.4 |\n| Less: cash compensation expense included above | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.5 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 3.5 |\n| Total | $63.9 | $81.7 | $40.7 | $36.9 | $5.4 | $0.3 | $228.9 |\n\n( 1 ) We have entered into certain acquisitions that contain both redeemable noncontrolling interests and call options with similar terms and conditions. In such instances, we have included the related estimated contingent acquisition obligation in the period when the earliest related option is exercisable. We have certain redeemable noncontrolling interests that are exercisable at the discretion of the noncontrolling equity owners as of December 31, 2009. As such, these estimated acquisition payments of $20.5 have been included within the total payments expected to be made in 2010 in the table and, if not made in 2010, will continue to carry forward into 2011 or beyond until they are exercised or expire. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are included in the table at current exercise price payable in cash, not at applicable redemption value in accordance with the authoritative guidance for classification and measurement of redeemable securities. \n\nLegal matters \nWe are involved in legal and administrative proceedings of various types. While any litigation contains an element of uncertainty, we do not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \n\nNote 16: Recent accounting standards \nIn December 2009, the financial accounting standards board amended authoritative guidance related to accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. The guidance will be effective for the company beginning January 1, 2010. The guidance eliminates the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity and changes the criteria for derecognizing financial assets. In addition, the guidance will require additional disclosures related to a company's continued involvement with financial assets that have been transferred. We do not expect the adoption of this amended guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2009, the FASB amended authoritative guidance for consolidating variable interest entities. The guidance will be effective for the company beginning January 1, 2010. Specifically, the guidance revises factors that should be considered by a reporting entity when determining whether an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting ( or similar rights ) should be consolidated. This guidance also includes revised financial statement disclosures regarding the reporting entity's involvement, including significant risk exposures as a result of that involvement, and the impact the relationship has on the reporting entity's financial statements. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the amended guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\n"

            "answer": "The defered acquisition payments decreased from 34.8 million to 1.2 million dollars, so the change is 34.8 - 1.2 = 33.6 million dollars. The percent change is then 100 * (33.6 / 34.8) = [[96.55]]%"
