                "context":"3.1 Financial risk factors (continued)\n(a) Market risk (continued)\n(iii) Interest rate risk (continued)\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2019, the Group entered into certain interest rate swap contracts to hedge its exposure arising from borrowings carried at floating rates. Under these interest rate swap contracts, the Group agreed with the counterparties to exchange, at specified interval, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts. These interest rate swap contracts had the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates and were qualified for hedge accounting. Details of the Group\u2019s outstanding interest rate swap contracts as at 31 December 2019 have been disclosed in Note 38.\nThe effects of the interest rate swaps on the Group\u2019s financial position and performance are as follows:\nSwaps currently in place cover majority of the floating-rate borrowing and notes payable principal outstanding.\nAs at 31 December 2019 and 2018, management considered that any reasonable changes in the interest rates would not result in a significant change in the Group\u2019s results as the Group\u2019s exposure to cash flow interest-rate risk arising from its borrowings and notes payable carried at floating rates after considering the effect of hedging is considered to be insignificant. Accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is presented for interest rate risk.\n|  | 2019 | 2018 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n|  | (Millions) | (Millions) |\n| Interest rate swaps |  |  |\n| Carrying amount (non-current (liabilities)\/assets) | (494) | 1,663 |\n| Notional amount | 29,423 | 77,630 |\n| Maturity date | 30\/7\/2021~ | 28\/6\/2019~ |\n|  | 11\/4\/2024 | 8\/12\/2023 |\n| Hedge ratio | 1:1 | 1:1 |\n| Change in fair value of outstanding hedging instruments since 1 January | (2,139) | 181 |\n| Change in value of hedged item used to determine hedgeeffectiveness | (2,139) | 181 |\n| Weighted average hedged rate for the year | 2.10% | 1.60% |\n"
